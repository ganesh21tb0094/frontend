    <p>A <b>Full-stack developer</b> is a software professional skilled in building both the <i>user-facing
            front-end</i>
        (client-side) and
        <i>the server-side back-end of web applications and websites</i>. <del>That is very hard to learn.</del> They
        possess a broad skill set covering database
        management,
        server-side scripting, and user interface development using <mark>various programming languages, frameworks, and
            tools
            to
            handle </mark>all aspects of the development process, from conception to deployment.

    <p>A full stack developer works on both <ins>the front-end</ins> <i>(the user-facing part of a website or

        <i>(the server-side logic, databases, and APIs)</i>, handling the entire development process from concept to
        deployment.
